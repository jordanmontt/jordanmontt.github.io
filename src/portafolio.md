## About Me

I am a software engineer that currently works as a research engineer at [INRIA - Lille](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-lille-nord-europe) (National Institute or Research in Science and Technology, France, Lille).

I am a PhD student working on memory profilers. I work at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille), France in the Evref team.

I was one of the main developers of the [pharo-ai project](https://github.com/pharo-ai/) contributing and building different libraries for machine learning algorithms, statistical metrics, data preprocessing, and AI in general.
At INRIA, I also worked for 5 months as a [Moose engineer](https://github.com/moosetechnology) mostly developing tools for [Moose IDE project](https://github.com/moosetechnology/MooseIDE).

I work full time on open-source projects since the beginning of 2020. I have 1 year of experience working for web developing companies.
